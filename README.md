Designed as public infrastructure for verified trade, it enables real-time identity and compliance verification of exporters, aggregators, assayers, vault operators, and field agents within the AGX ecosystem. By providing a shared, auditable compliance layer for both public and private actors, the registry promotes transparency, trust, and legitimacy across national borders.
