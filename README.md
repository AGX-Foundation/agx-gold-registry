📦 agx-gold-registry
Overview
The AGX Open Compliance Registry is a public, API-accessible registry of certified participants in Africa’s gold supply chain—built to power trusted, traceable trade. Designed as a core component of the AGX Protocol, it enables real-time verification of exporters, aggregators, assayers, vault operators, field agents, and gold traders operating in high-value, high-risk environments.

Whether you're a government regulator, buyer, refiner, or financial institution, the Registry provides a shared compliance layer for identifying credible counterparties, viewing certification history, and tracing the legitimacy of gold across borders. Built for openness, the platform integrates seamlessly with AGX TradePass™, mobile onboarding workflows, and audit records, and is governed by a transparent, standards-aligned data architecture.
